# deep_learning_architecture
Image classifier that will predict what style of architecture a building is influenced by

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project  is to create an image classifier that will accurately predict what style of architecture a building
is influenced by. This would be very useful to any professionals in the real estate market who are looking to either label or search for property programmatically.

# Description of Hardware

I developed and executed this application on a custom linux box that i made running ubuntu on an Intel® CoreTM i5-6200 CPU processor. The laptop is equipped with 32 gigabytes of RAM and a dedicated graphics processing unit.
 
# Description of Software

This project is developed using keras, tensorflow and Python (version 3.6.3). I have been using Python on the Anaconda platform. Anaconda is a very useful and convenient Python Data Science Platform. It installs a variety of Python Packages of which we will be using Pandas Dataframes, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook. One can download the Anaconda platform from the following URL:
